# BrainTrain
Dynamically create and remove text, buttons that do stuff, timer, possible average (sec/done), recall matching check.

My future goals:
1. VISUAL APPEARANCE
  a. font size dynamically fits a box.
  b. Welcome!
  c. readable
  d. https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/
  e. less visual information present onscreen at a time (step by step)
  f. this means that when they are done reading, the "visual workspace" becomes replaced with the "recall text box" and submit button
  
2. BOLD the match
  a. after recall (how much did i remember) then display how long they spent recalling
  b. below time recalling element, redisplay the "intitial paragraph"
  c. all the MATCH word have become BOLD
  d. unmatched words are italics?
  
3. TIMER FUNCTIONS
  a. total time spent on page
  b. total time reading text
  c. total time recalling (or a countdown timer for this)
  d. average
